| DEPLOY-03 | Deploy echo harness container in bunker on :9191 | 🔴 Blocked — needs bunker agent first |
| DEPLOY-04 | Deploy Hermes+H3 container, harness config pointing at echo | 🔴 Blocked — needs bunker agent first |
| DEPLOY-05 | Configure test session routing (platform+chat_id → harness) | 🔴 Blocked — needs running containers |
| DEPLOY-06 | Send test message; verify full H3 round-trip | 🔴 Blocked — needs running infrastructure |
| DEPLOY-07 | Verify harness logs (METHOD /path STATUS DURATION) | 🔴 Blocked — needs running infrastructure |
| DEPLOY-08 | Write `DEPLOY.md` — deployment guide | ✅ Done (fece64e) |
