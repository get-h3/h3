# H3 umbrella verification entry point (GAP-053).
#
# A fresh clone of get-h3/h3 alone must be able to verify itself:
#   make verify
# Runs with zero dependencies (POSIX shell + coreutils) — no venv, no network.
#
# Checks:
#   1. docs-link      — every relative .md link in README.md and specs/_index.md
#                       resolves to a file that exists in the repo.
#   2. spec-index     — every spec file under specs/ is listed in specs/_index.md,
#                       and every spec listed in the index resolves to a real file.
